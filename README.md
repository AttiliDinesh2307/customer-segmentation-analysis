# Customer Segmentation Using Hypothesis Techniques

## Overview
This project analyzes customer data to identify distinct customer segments. By segmenting customers, businesses can gain valuable insights into their customer base, tailor marketing strategies, and improve product offerings to better meet the needs of different groups.

The analysis focuses on both demographic information (age, gender, income) and purchasing behavior (frequency, average spend, product categories, and payment methods).

---

## Data Overview
The dataset includes the following attributes:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer  
- **Age**: Age of the customer  
- **Gender**: Male or Female  
- **Income**: Annual income of the customer  
- **Income Group**: Grouped income category (Low, Medium, High)  
- **Purchase Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase (Rarely, Occasionally, Frequently, Monthly)  
- **Average Purchase Amount**: Typical amount spent per purchase  
- **Product Categories Purchased**: List of product categories purchased  
 

---

## Analysis Performed
To understand customer segmentation, the following statistical tests were applied:

1. **ANOVA for Age Groups**  
   - Tested differences in purchase frequency across three age groups: 18‚Äì25, 26‚Äì35, and 36‚Äì45.  
   - **Result**: p-value = 0.093 ‚Üí No statistically significant difference.

2. **ANOVA for Income Groups**  
   - Tested differences in average purchase amount across income levels: 0‚Äì4 Lakhs, 4.1‚Äì9 Lakhs, and 9.1 Lakhs or above.  
   - **Result**: p-value = 0.00055 ‚Üí Statistically significant difference. Income level strongly influences average purchase amount.

3. **T-Test for Gender**  
   - Compared average purchase amount between male and female customers.  
   - **Result**: p-value = 0.690 ‚Üí No statistically significant difference.

---

## Key Findings
- **Income Level** is the most significant factor influencing customer purchasing behavior.  
- **Age** and **Gender** do not show strong influence on purchase frequency or average purchase amount.  
- Segmenting customers by **income group** is the most effective strategy for designing targeted offers and pricing.

---

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests that businesses should focus on **income-based customer segmentation** to refine marketing strategies, optimize product positioning, and personalize promotional campaigns. Age and gender are less relevant in influencing purchasing behavior in this dataset.


# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## üìå Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to customer data to identify distinct customer segments.  
By grouping customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior, businesses can better understand their customer base, design targeted marketing strategies, and improve loyalty and retention.

The analysis focuses on three key features:
- **Age** (demographics)  
- **Annual Income** (spending power)  
- **Purchase Frequency** (engagement/behavior)  

---

## üìä Data Overview
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer  
- **Age**: Age of the customer  
- **Income**: Annual income (converted from ranges into numeric midpoints)  
- **Purchase Frequency**: Number of purchases made in a given period  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed symbols like ‚Çπ and commas  
   - Converted income ranges (e.g., `410000 - 655999`) into numeric midpoints  
   - Ensured all features were numeric  

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Selected `Age`, `Income`, and `Purchase Frequency`  
   - These provide a mix of demographic and behavioral information  

3. **Standardization**
   - Applied `StandardScaler` to scale features so no single feature (like Income) dominates clustering  

4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Applied **K-Means** with `n_clusters = 4`  
   - Customers were grouped into four segments based on similarities  

5. **Visualization**
   - Used a scatterplot with **Annual Income vs. Purchase Frequency** to visualize clusters  
   - Each cluster was color-coded for interpretation

## üîç Results: Cluster Profiles

| Cluster | Avg Age | Avg Income | Avg Purchase Freq | Profile & Insights |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **0** | ~38 yrs | ~10.7 lakh | 3 | Older, high-income, moderate buyers. Good candidates for premium products and loyalty rewards. |
| **1** | ~27 yrs | ~5.25 lakh | 1.75 | Younger, mid-income, low-frequency shoppers. Need promotions/discounts to increase engagement. |
| **2** | ~28 yrs | ~5.33 lakh | 5 | Younger, mid-income, frequent shoppers. Already engaged. Focus on retention through rewards and personalization. |
| **3** | 26 yrs | ~5.33 lakh | 12 | Very young, mid-income, super frequent buyers. Core champions. Keep them loyal with exclusive offers and early access. |

---

## üìà Key Findings
- Income is not the only differentiator ‚Äî customers with similar income levels show very different shopping frequencies.  
- **Cluster 0** shows that high-income individuals do not always purchase frequently ‚Üí potential for targeted upselling.  
- **Clusters 2 & 3** highlight younger customers with strong engagement ‚Üí critical for long-term loyalty strategies.  
- **Cluster 1** represents occasional shoppers who may need targeted campaigns to increase spending.  

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
The clustering analysis provides a **behavior-driven view** of customers compared to demographic-only analysis. Businesses can:
- Design personalized strategies for frequent vs. occasional shoppers  
- Create premium programs for high-income but low-frequency customers  
- Focus on retention and loyalty for engaged younger buyers
